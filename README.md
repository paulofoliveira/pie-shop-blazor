# pie-shop-blazor
Pie Shop built in Blazor following Blazor Getting Started course by Pluralsight with Gill Clereen.

My goal in this course is learn how I can use blazor to create reactive aplications following the line of SPA applications like Angular, React and Vue. Obviouslly I prefer to continue using C# and my knowledgements in .NET with ASP.NET Core and what I can improve with a new skill with Blazor and, if this technology can be important to start a new project that I intent starting in a future.
